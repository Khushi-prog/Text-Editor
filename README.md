# Text-Editor
This is a simple text editor made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a little bit of PHP. The editor is fully functional, allowing you to write, delete, and select text with both keyboard and mouse support. It also includes some nice features, such as special handling of URLs. Additionally, it utilizes a XAMPP server with a local host to save user registration details.

# Prerequisites -
Before getting started with the Text-Editor project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

XAMPP server installed on your system-
https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html

# Installation-:
To set up the Text-Editor project, follow these steps:

Install XAMPP server on your system by downloading it from the official website mentioned above.

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Text-Editor.git

Move the cloned repository to the appropriate directory of your XAMPP server. For example, in a typical XAMPP installation on Windows, move it to the htdocs folder.

Start the XAMPP server and make sure both Apache and MySQL services are running.

Open a web browser and access the Text-Editor application using the following URL:

http://localhost/Text-Editor/

# Usage
Once the Text-Editor application is running in your web browser, you can perform the following actions:

Write and edit text using the editor's interface.
Use both the keyboard and mouse to select and delete text.
Take advantage of special URL handling, which recognizes and formats URLs for easy navigation.
Register your details through the application, which will be stored on the local XAMPP server.
